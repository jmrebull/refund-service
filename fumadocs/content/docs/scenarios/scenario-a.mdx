title: Scenario A — Full refund, single payment
description: Refund the exact transaction total back to the single payment method
---

The simplest case. The full transaction total is returned to the single payment method.
No proportional distribution or rounding is required.

## Formula

```python
total_refund             = transaction.total
payment[0].refund_amount = transaction.total
```

## Example

**Transaction:** `TXN-REG-001` — `64.00 USD`, paid by `CARD`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/refunds \
  -H "X-API-Key: SOLARA-SECRET-2026" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_id": "TXN-REG-001",
    "operator_id": "op1",
    "reason": "customer request"
  }'
```

**Response (201):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "refund_id": "RF-A1B2C3D4",
    "transaction_id": "TXN-REG-001",
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "total_refund_amount": "64.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "calculation_breakdown": {
      "scenario": "A: Full refund, single payment method",
      "total_refund": "64.00",
      "payment_breakdown": [
        {
          "payment_id": "PAY-REG-001",
          "payment_type": "CARD",
          "original_amount": "64.00",
          "refund_amount": "64.00",
          "currency": "USD"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## When this scenario applies

- Transaction has exactly one payment method
- No `item_ids` in the request
- Transaction is not an installment transaction
- Transaction is not cross-border

<Callout>
  If the transaction has multiple payment methods, the engine uses
  [Scenario B](/docs/scenarios/scenario-b) instead.
