## Key properties

- **Financial precision** — All arithmetic uses `decimal.Decimal` with `ROUND_HALF_UP`. Floating-point is never used for monetary values.
- **Immutable audit trail** — Every operation appends `REFUND_REQUESTED` and `REFUND_APPROVED` (or `REFUND_REJECTED`) events that are never modified or deleted.
- **Idempotency** — Pass `idempotency_key` in the request body to safely retry without creating duplicates.
- **Deterministic** — Refund amounts are computed entirely from data stored at purchase time. No live rate lookups.

<Callout type="warn">
  This API processes **refunds only**. Chargebacks, voids, and pre-capture authorizations are handled by separate services.
