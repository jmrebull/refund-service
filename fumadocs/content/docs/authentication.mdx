title: Authentication
description: All endpoints require an API key passed via the X-API-Key header
---

Every request must include the `X-API-Key` header. The key is configured on the server via the `API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/refunds \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Never pass the API key as a query parameter — it will appear in server logs and proxy access logs.
</Callout>

## Error responses

| Scenario | HTTP | Code |
|----------|------|------|
| Missing `X-API-Key` header | 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| Incorrect key value | 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 5 failed attempts from the same IP | 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` (60 s lockout) |

## Rate limiting

Authentication failures are rate-limited per IP address. After 5 consecutive failed attempts, further requests from that IP return `429 RATE_LIMITED` for 60 seconds, regardless of whether the correct key is provided.

<Callout>
  Successful requests do not count toward the rate limit. Only authentication failures are tracked.
</Callout>

## Local development

For local development, the default key is `SOLARA-SECRET-2026`. Override it by setting `API_KEY` in your `.env` file before starting the server.
